We are proud to say that over 90% of our current collection is made from organic pima cotton.<\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em>Oeko-Tex Dyes:<\/em><\/span> Our organic cotton fabric is then dyed and printed using only OEKO-TEX 100 standard dyes, meaning they are certified free of over 100 substances known to be toxic and harmful to people and the environment.  OEKO-TEX is a different, yet equally important, global textile standard from GOTS.  We believe that adhering to both certifications along our supply chain process makes for the safest product for our customers, our supply chain partners and ultimately our planet.<\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em>Recycled Fabric:<\/em><\/span> Beginning in 2021, we began incorporating recycled material in the production process of select styles.  We have been able to offer our customer a swim product that is made of 74% recycled material, via our environmentally-conscious production partner in this category.  Incorporating more recycled material in our products is a longer-term goal that we continue to research and pursue.  We are also seeking ways to reduce unusable fabric waste by turning fabric cuttings into new styles, such as headbands and other accessories. <\/p>"
