Several years into her career, Amy became pregnant with her first son. By the time he was three, he had developed severe allergies to tree nuts and soon Amy and her husband learned that both of their children suffered from multiple food and skin allergies. This launched her mission to find clothing that was both organic and gentle on her boys’ skin, while not compromising the modern, clean aesthetic she was looking for. When everything in the market fell short of Amy’s expectations, she took her own fashion industry experience and joined together with her friend Stacey to launch 12|12. At 12|12, Amy oversees planning, merchandising and operations.<\/p>",

Stacey shared Amy's interest in quality, craftsmanship and modern organic clothing for babies. When pregnant with her first, Amy and Stacey spent an afternoon discussing the children's clothing market and the lack of quality options available at the time. It was the desire to create something better that brought them together and compelled them to create 12|12.Through years of growth—including long days and late nights with their own babies—Stacey and Amy are as dedicated as ever to ensuring that 12|12 continues to set the standard for quality organic clothing for babies and toddlers—so there’s no more guessing in getting them dressed. <\/p>",
